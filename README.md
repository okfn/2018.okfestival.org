==============

This site is built with [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/).

It has a bunch of [dependencies](package.json), so do `npm install` and then `npm run build`.

`grunt` will watch for changes to your [SCSS files](assets/scss).

`lektor deploy` will deploy to the gh-pages branch, putting changes live (if you have deploy permissions).
